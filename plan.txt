Phase 3: core functionality:
1. input handling
    keyboard input
        add a state variable to track when in 'ins' mode
        update all the MANY add functions to acknowledge this ins state
        update del to work given the positioning
        update backspace to operate as a keypress version of del
        finalize spacebar as hotkey to toggle secondary
2. mathematical computations
    carefully implement PEMDAS
    integrate pythons math module for calculations
    handle fractions, percentages, and memory operations
3. display updates
    implement real time updates for input and results (maybe)
    support the two line display (current input and previous calculation)

Phase 4: Advanced features and polishing:
1. error handling and edge cases
    divide by 0
    invalid input (eg log(-1))
    entered text extends beyond the bounds of the app viewport
    get the full list of possible errors to determine a plan
2. theming and styling
    make the ui look right
        consider button skins and fonts
3. memory
    perfect history recall
4. menus
    there are so many menus and i have no idea what any of them do
5. nice-to-have's
    initially, the up arrow key will correspond to looking for the last performed calculation. have something where the users can customize the keymap
    see about performance improvements in terms of efficiency
    add an absolute value function Abs and have its syntax be abs()

Phase 5: testing and deployment
1. unit tests for calculations
2. user testing for ui usability
3. create an executable


NOTES: 
some keyboard-potential functions were not included oob for the sake of clarity or avoiding ambiguity: 
inverse trig (to get to sin^-1, you have to first type sin, at which point the calculator adds sin),
all the menu functions (they necessarily will involve button clicks on the menu itself, and thus are limited to button clicks on the calculator interface)
e and EE (to keep hotkeys case-independent)
currently, I'm anticipating including custom hotkey creation. i'm also anticipating that being a struggle which is maybe out of scope for this app. so we will see.
