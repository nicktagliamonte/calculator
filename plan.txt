Phase 1
1. select the framework
    pyqt/pyside
2. set up the development environment
    install dependencies
    set up a git repo

Phase 2: ui design and layout
1. create the main window
    set up two line display
    set up grid layout for buttons
2. design buttons
    Basic operations: +, -, ×, ÷, =
    Scientific functions: sin, cos, tan, log, ^, √
    Memory functions: M+, M-, MR, MC
    Other features: fraction, percent, ANS, (-), ON/CLEAR

Phase 3: core functionality:
1. input handling
    button presses
    keyboard input
2. mathematical computations
    carefully implement PEMDAS
    integrate pythons math module for calculations
    handle fractions, percentages, and memory operations
3. display updates
    implement real time updates for input and results (maybe)
    support the two line display (current input and previous calculation)

Phase 4: Advanced features and polishing:
1. error handling and edge cases
    divide by 0
    invalid input (eg log(-1))
2. theming and styling
    make the ui look right
        consider button skins and fonts
3. memory
    perfect history recall
4. nice-to-have's
    initially, the up arrow key will correspond to looking for the last performed calculation. have something where the users can customize the keymap
    see about performance improvements in terms of efficiency

Phase 5: testing and deployment
1. unit tests for calculations
2. user testing for ui usability
3. create an executable
